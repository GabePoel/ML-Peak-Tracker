# Lorentzian Peak Finder (now with MaChInE lEaRnInG!)

A python library for finding, fitting to, and tracking Lorentzian peaks from RUS or other measurements. Usage and documentation can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/GabePoel/ML-Peak-Tracker/wiki).

## Installing

Just run the following to install directly from this repository.
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/GabePoel/ML-Peak-Tracker#egg=peak_finder --user
```
The download and installation may take a while because the trained models are rather chunky. If you want, you can choose to install it _not_ as a user if you're that kind of person and like living on the edge.
